      The research project objective consists of implementing an increased security algorithm within a Matlab simulation environment. Intent is for the increased security to be applicable to IoT devices for encrypted data transmission. Testing consists of various attack methods and comparing our results with those of other algorithms in use. Algorithm is an XOR shift with random number implementation which verifies the ReaderID's and TagID's between devices prior to information sharing.
